class S1SLC(Dataset):
    r"""
    The Polarimetric SAR dataset with the labels provided by
    https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/s1slccvdl-complex-valued-annotated-single-look-complex-sentinel-1-sar-dataset-complex

    We expect the data to be already downloaded and available on your drive.

    Arguments:
        root: the top root dir where the data are expected. The data should be organized as follows: Sao Paulo/HH.npy, Sao Paulo/HV.npy, Sao Paulo/Labels.npy, Houston/HH.npy, Houston/HV.npy, Houston/Labels.npy, Chicago/HH.npy, Chicago/HV.npy, Chicago/Labels.npy
        transform : the transform applied the cropped image
        lazy_loading : if True, the data is loaded only when requested. If False, the data is loaded at the initialization of the dataset.

    Note:
        An example usage :

        .. code-block:: python

            import torchcvnn
            from torchcvnn.datasets import S1SLC

                # S1SLC provides the dual HH, HV polarizations
